1069342932249899000,"So there's this thing called the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem -- when point-level data is aggregated into geographic districts, the resulting numbers can tell a story that isn't real. These stories change depending on the modifiable areal unit.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1069342932249899008
1238556851643519000,"Hello, good afternoon, let's do another mappy Twitter-torial, shall we? Today's topic is visualizing aggregate data. Mostly it's a critique of this map, which you've probably seen quite a bit. It has great data! But I take issue with the techniques used. https://t.co/98qqpkxhDG",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238556851643518981
1238557962236579800,"We are all familiar with maps that visualize aggregate data. The most common one you've probably seen is a ""choropleth"" map -- a map of areas that are filled in with a color or pattern that tell you something about that area. Like this electoral map from the BBC: https://t.co/USzzwrghOu",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238557962236579844
1238559830828253200,"The colors on the map share information: which party won the district, and by what percentage. Choropleth maps have many of their own issues (making assumptions about large geographic areas), but are useful for showing data aggregated at an area level.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238559830828253186
1238560988619817000,"There are two other common ways to show aggregated data: a ""dot density"" map and a ""graduated symbol"" map. Dot density maps use one dot to represent some number of things you're mapping, and cluster the dots in geographic areas. Here's one cool example from Bill Rankin (2009) https://t.co/A1bw37WjVQ",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238560988619816963
1238561449351557000,"Each dot represents 25 people in Chicago. That dot is not providing a specific geographic location of those 25 people, but a random location inside that geographic area (along with the other dots in the geographic area. Striking, no? It does a nice job of telling the story.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238561449351557122
1238562354239078400,"Finally, we have graduated symbol maps (aka ""proportional symbols""). These use a symbol (often a circle) to represent a geographic area, and the size and/or color of the symbol is related to some aspect of the data. Example: the Johns Hopkins coronavirus map. https://t.co/vXLnRsULhs",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238562354239078401
1238563186707697700,"In the case of this map, each dot represents a state/province or country (depends on the region, in the US it's states) and the radius of the circle tells us how many confirmed cases are in that area. (Also fun: note that the scale isn't linear, but logarithmic!) https://t.co/DL8Nccx2Yi",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238563186707697664
1238563754922643500,What is this map trying to tell us? It's trying to convey the total number of cases of COVID-19 across the world. Does it do a good job of that? Yes and no. Here are some of my critiques of this map.,lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238563754922643458
1238564009672085500,"1. Knowing the total number of cases in an area is useful. Knowing the number of cases within a political boundary is also useful... to a point. If I live on the border of Washington and Oregon (say, in Portland), that state border doesn't mean that much to me.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238564009672085510
1238564199128879000,"In terms of containment and state response, yes it feels like it's helpful to know how many cases are in a state. From an epidemiology perspective, viruses don't really care about state borders. This touches on a concept called the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238564199128879105
1238564846574145500,"The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem is about how changing boundary areas can fully change the results of a spatial analysis. This leads to an ecological fallacy: the idea that these borders matter when it comes to this data. (For more, this Twitter-torial: https://t.co/brI7I1xTsD)",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238564846574145536
1238565387647754200,"So, in my humble opinion, number of cases per geographic area is useful, but only in terms of that geographic area's official response.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238565387647754241
1238565819916923000,"2. This is a slippy map, meaning I can pan around and zoom in and out. So useful! It also means that I'm going to zoom right into my hometown to see if there are any cases here. Right now I live in New York City, where I know there are cases. But what happens when I zoom in? https://t.co/9lR9Ccnicb",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238565819916922880
1238566350383169500,"Nothing there! You know why? Because the graduated symbol denoting the number of cases in the state is placed on the geographical centroid of the state, triangulated roughly between Binghamton and Oneonta. https://t.co/bDn9RHg9Vv",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238566350383169541
1238566384948277200,@lyzidiamond Never heard 'slippy map' before... i like it. :),notestoself,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238566384948277248
1238566716034232300,"The centroid of an area is the mean position of all its points -- not quite the ""center"" of the area, but pretty close. If I was making a print map, this would make total sense. It's a lot easier to tell what's going on when you're zoomed out! But...",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238566716034232320
1238567073732866000,"if I didn't know about graduated symbols, how these maps are made, what they're trying to tell me... I might assume that NYC is fine and all New York cases are centered around the town of Downsville, New York. That's where the marker is!",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238567073732866048
1238567378461622300,"On top of that, the graduated symbols disappear once you zoom in past zoom level 7. So if I did believe that all New York cases were located there, I wouldn't even really know where ""there"" is because the symbol disappears before I can zoom in that far.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238567378461622273
1238567667935690800,So. How do we make this map more clear? What steps can a cartographer take to tell this story better?,lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238567667935690752
1238567978691702800,One option is to set zoom bounds. Don't let the user zoom in past a certain level. This signals that more fine-grained data doesn't exist and makes it clear that the graduated symbols represent an aggregate.,lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238567978691702784
1238568410239377400,"But honestly I'm also stuck on what this map is trying to show/tell. Showing confirmed cases aggregated by state or country doesn't seem that useful to me, as an individual. What about cases over time? How might that be visualized? What about population-adjusted stats?",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238568410239377409
1238568692050464800,"I know this data is coming in hot and fast and we don't know how reliable it is, so I understand that it's important to get any information out there that helps the world understand what's going on. The problem is that so many maps cause active harm by telling the wrong story.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238568692050464768
1238569235711959000,"General advice: When you aggregate data, you're necessarily abstracting out details and nuance in that data. It is our responsibility as cartographers to make sure we do that responsibly and ethically, in particular by sharing our methodology and explaining our results.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238569235711959051
1238569653770780700,"Also, MAP LITERACY IS IMPORTANT AND WE SHOULD KEEP TEACHING IT TO PEOPLE, EVEN IN THE AGE OF GOOGLE MAPS. Maps are historical tools of oppression, and it's up to us to be critical of data visualization of all kinds rather than taking it at face value.",lyzidiamond,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238569653770780673
1238570038162083800,"@lyzidiamond Well, I'm also unsure how ""useful"" the map is, but that's true for most of the data presented about Covid. It is an informative map though, so I wouldn't over-criticise it.",BaileyNagy,https://twitter.com/user/status/1238570038162083841
